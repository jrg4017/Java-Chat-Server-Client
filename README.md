# JavaChatServerClient 

The server for the Chat is in the ChatServer folder

The client for the Chat is in the ChatClient folder. Multiple clients can be ran at the same time. The client will hang if no server is running and will appear once a server has been set up.

A video of the code running has been uploaded to [YouTube](https://youtu.be/kEWFHujtF8U) for your convenience.

Soon I will upload a jar file for nayone interested in downloading and running the program.
